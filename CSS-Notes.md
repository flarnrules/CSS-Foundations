## 2 Basic CSS Syntax

At it's most basic level, CSS works like this:

    selector {
        property1: value1;
        property2: value2;
        property3: value3;
    }


The below diagram outlines the basic syntax for CSS

> ### Side note on `<div>`
>
> A `<div>` is one of the basic HTML elements. It is an empty container. Generally we want to use other elements like `<h1>` or `<p>` for content, but sometimes you will just need a container. In The Odin Project we will use plain `<div>`s to start, but later we will go into more detail.
