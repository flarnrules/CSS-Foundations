> # Side note on <div>
> A `<div>` is one of the basic HTML elements. It is an empty container. Generally we want to use other elements like `<h1>` or `<p>` for content, but sometimes you will just need a container. In The Odin Project we will use plain `<div>`s to start, but later we will go into more detail.
